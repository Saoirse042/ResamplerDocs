=== "Shared flags"
	| Flag | Name             | Range      | Default | Description                                                                    |
	|:----:|------------------|------------|:-------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
	| g    | Gender           |`[-100-100]`| 0       | Positive values will deepen the voice, while negative ones will make it higher.|
	| B    |                  |`[0-100]`   | 50      | Applies breathiness before synthesis, and is affected by other flags.          |
	| N    | Formant on/off   |            |         | Toggles the formant filter on or off.                                          |
	| P    | Peak compressor  |`[0-100]`   | 86      | Compresses the voice to make the volume more consistent.                       |
	| t    | Pitch            |            | 0       | Shifts the pitch by a number of cents. 1 cent = 1/100th of a semitone.         |


=== "Unique flags"
	| Flag |  Description |        
	|:----:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
	|   A  | High frequency emphasis rate of the noise component (default setting a100)|
	|   R  | Backwards. reverse front and back|
	|   S  | Number of threads By default, the number of threads corresponds to the number of logical cores on the computer.|
	|   i  | length of the rear fixed area (ms)|
	|   v  | consonant velocity of the rear fixed area |
	
!!! info "File formats"
	Previously, if a file format other than `.wav` is found in `oto.ini`, [resampler](/ResamplerDocs/resampler.exe) would append `.wav` to the file name like this:
	:	`aaa.mp3` â†’ `aaa.mp3.wav`<br>

	Now, with environment variables set, Doppeltler is able to read files in their original format. See [tools](/ResamplerDocs/tools) for setting up encoders and environment variables.
	
### Other Notes

* Input files are no longer required to be sampled at 44100Hz
* You can also set a consonant velocity of the rear fixed area in the form of "front/back" for the i argument. UTAU itself does not currently support this.
* You can also set the rear fixed length in the form of "front/back" in the fixed length of the v argument. UTAU itself does not currently support this.
